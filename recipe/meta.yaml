# On Windows ZeroMQ is bundled with pyzmq.
# On Windows pyzmq includes tweetnacl so libsodium is not used.
# We should revisit these in the future. However, packaging libsodium
# on Windows is complicated by the fact that they ship project files,
# but don't include one for VS 2008, which we would need for Python 2.7.

  # We run the zmq tests on all platforms except Windows.
  # The only reason not to run the tests on Windows is that
  # they terminate with an interactive prompt. See also
